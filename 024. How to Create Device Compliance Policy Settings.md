# Lecture Notes: Modifying Default Compliance Policy Settings in Microsoft Intune

---

## Overview

* **Topic:** Modifying **Default Compliance Policy Settings**
* **Platform:** Microsoft Intune (Microsoft Endpoint Manager)
* **Scope:** Tenant-wide baseline compliance behavior
* **Purpose:** Control how Intune evaluates devices that do not receive a device compliance policy

---

## Compliance Model in Intune

Microsoft Intune compliance is structured into **two layers**:

---

### 1. Compliance Policy Settings (Tenant-Wide)

* Acts as a **built-in baseline compliance policy**
* Applies to **all devices in the tenant**
* Controls:

  * How devices are treated when **no compliance policy is assigned**
  * How long a device can go without reporting compliance
  * Jailbreak detection behavior (iOS/iPadOS)

> These settings define the **foundation** for how compliance works in your environment.

---

### 2. Device Compliance Policies (Platform-Specific)

* Created and assigned to:

  * User groups
  * Device groups
* Defines **actual technical requirements**, such as:

  * Minimum OS version
  * Disk encryption (BitLocker)
  * Secure boot
  * Password requirements
  * Antivirus status

> Devices must meet these rules to be marked **Compliant**.

---

## Why Default Compliance Policy Settings Matter

By default, Intune considers:

> **Devices with NO compliance policy assigned = ComPLIANT**

This can be a **security risk** when using:

* Conditional Access
* Zero Trust access models

Because unmanaged or unvalidated devices may still access corporate resources.

---

## Administrative Access Required

* Global Administrator
  **OR**
* Intune Administrator

---

## Step 1: Access Microsoft Endpoint Manager

### Portal URL

```plaintext
https://endpoint.microsoft.com
```

---

## Step 2: Verify Current Compliance Behavior

### Navigation

1. Click **Devices**
2. Click **All Devices**
3. Select a **Windows 10 device**

---

### Check Compliance Status

1. Select **Monitor**
2. Click **Device Compliance**

---

### Observed Behavior

* Built-in compliance policy is applied
* Error shows:

  * **Has a compliance policy assigned: Not Applicable**
* Device still shows:

  * **Status = Compliant**

This confirms:

> Tenant-level settings allow devices without compliance policies to be treated as compliant.

---

## Step 3: Open Compliance Policy Settings

### Navigation

1. Click **Devices**
2. Select **Compliance Policies**
3. Click **Compliance Policy Settings**

---

## Key Tenant-Wide Settings Explained

---

## 1. Devices with No Compliance Policy Assigned

### Setting Name

**Mark devices with no compliance policy assigned as**

### Default Value

**Compliant**

### Available Options

* **Compliant**
* **Not Compliant**

---

### Security Recommendation

If using **Conditional Access**, set this to:

> **Not Compliant**

### Why?

This ensures:

* Only devices that **explicitly receive and pass a compliance policy**
* Can access corporate resources such as:

  * Microsoft 365
  * VPN
  * SharePoint
  * Azure Applications

---

### Configuration Example

Set value to:
**Not Compliant**

---

## 2. Enhanced Jailbreak Detection (iOS / iPadOS Only)

### Applies To

* iOS
* iPadOS

### Purpose

Improves detection accuracy for:

* Jailbroken devices

### Behavior

Works only when:

* A **device compliance policy** exists
* The policy explicitly **blocks jailbroken devices**

### Recommendation

Enable if:

* Your organization manages Apple devices
* Security posture requires mobile device integrity enforcement

---

## 3. Compliance Status Validity Period

### Purpose

Controls how long a device can go **without reporting compliance status** before being marked non-compliant.

---

### Default Value

**30 days**

---

### Configurable Range

**1–120 days**

---

### Example Configuration

Set value to:
**2 days**

### Result

If a device:

* Fails to check in within 2 days
* It becomes **Non-Compliant**

---

### Security Use Case

This helps detect:

* Powered-off devices
* Lost devices
* Devices that stopped communicating with Intune

---

## Step 4: Save Settings

1. Click **Save**
2. Wait for confirmation message:

   > Compliance policy settings saved successfully

---

## Resulting Behavior After Changes

| Scenario                                        | Result          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Device has no compliance policy                 | ❌ Non-Compliant |
| Device fails to check in within validity period | ❌ Non-Compliant |
| Device violates compliance rules                | ❌ Non-Compliant |
| Device passes compliance policy                 | ✅ Compliant     |

---

## Impact on Conditional Access

Once configured:

* Non-compliant devices will be:

  * Blocked from Microsoft 365
  * Blocked from Azure apps
  * Forced to remediate before access

---

## Best Practices

### Enterprise Recommendations

* Always set:

  > **No policy assigned = Not Compliant**
* Use:

  * Short validity period (1–7 days) for high-security environments
* Always:

  * Deploy compliance policies to **all platforms**
* Pair with:

  * Conditional Access rules

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Leaving default value as **Compliant**
* Not assigning compliance policies to all devices
* Setting very high validity periods (90+ days)
* Using Conditional Access without compliance enforcement

---

## Summary

In this session, you:

✔ Verified built-in compliance behavior
✔ Modified tenant-wide compliance baseline
✔ Secured unmanaged devices
✔ Improved device reporting enforcement

---

## What’s Next

Next module:

> **Create and Deploy Platform-Specific Device Compliance Policies**

This will define:

* OS version requirements
* Encryption rules
* Security settings
* Password enforcement

---

## Key Takeaway

> **Default compliance settings define your security baseline.**
> Device compliance policies define your enforcement rules.

Both must work together for a secure Intune environment.
