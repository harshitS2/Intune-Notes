# Lecture Notes: Creating a Device Compliance Notification Message Template in Microsoft Intune

---

## Overview

* **Topic:** Device Compliance Notification Message Template
* **Platform:** Microsoft Intune (Microsoft Endpoint Manager)
* **Scope:** Tenant-wide email notifications for non-compliant devices
* **Purpose:** Notify users when their device becomes non-compliant and guide them toward remediation

---

## Why Compliance Notifications Matter

By default, when Intune detects that a device does not meet compliance requirements, it is immediately marked as **Non-Compliant**.

However, Intune allows administrators to define **Actions for Non-Compliance**, such as:

* Granting a **grace period** before blocking access
* Sending an **email notification** to the device user
* Triggering remediation workflows

To send an email notification, you must first create a **Notification Message Template**.

---

## Administrative Access Required

* **Global Administrator**
  **OR**
* **Intune Administrator**

---

## Step 1: Access Microsoft Endpoint Manager

### Portal URL

```plaintext
https://endpoint.microsoft.com
```

---

## Step 2: Navigate to Notification Templates

### Navigation Path

1. Click **Devices**
2. Click **All Devices**
3. Under **Policy**, select **Compliance Policies**
4. Click **Notifications**

---

## Step 3: Create a New Notification Template

1. Click **Create** (➕ icon)

## Step 4: Configure Email Branding Options

You can optionally enable:

* ✔ Company Logo
* ✔ Company Name
* ✔ Contact Information
* ✔ Link to Company Portal Website

> These values are pulled from your **Company Portal Branding Configuration**.
> If branding is not configured, these options may not display correctly.

Click **Next** to continue.

---

## Step 5: Configure Message Language

### Default Language Selection

1. Select **English (United States)**
2. Enable **Set as Default**

> Only **one language** can be marked as default.

---

## Step 6: Define Email Content

### Subject Line

Example:

> `Your device is not compliant`

### Message Body

Enter a message explaining:

* Why the device is non-compliant
* What the user must do
* Where to get support

---

### Character Limits

| Field        | Maximum Characters |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Subject      | 78                 |

### Sample Enterprise Message

> Hello,
>
> Your device has been detected as non-compliant with your organization’s security policies.
>
> Please open the Company Portal application and follow the remediation steps to restore compliance.
>
> If you require assistance, contact the IT Support Team.
>
> Thank you,
> IT Security Team

## Step 7: Review and Create

1. Review all settings
2. Click **Create**

---

## Step 8: Manage the Template

After creation, you can:

### Edit Template

  * Subject
  * Message
  * Language
  * Branding options

### Send Preview Email

* Click **Send Preview Email**
* The email is sent to the **signed-in administrator’s mailbox**

> This allows you to validate formatting, branding, and messaging before assigning the template to a compliance policy.

---

## How This Template Is Used

The notification template is applied inside a **Device Compliance Policy** under:

> **Actions for Non-Compliance**

Common use cases:

* Send email after **1 day of non-compliance**
* Block access after **3 days**
* Mark device as non-compliant immediately

---

## Best Practices

### Enterprise Recommendations

  * Clear
  * Action-oriented
  * Support-focused
* Always include:

  * Link to Company Portal

  * Professional tone

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Creating templates but never assigning them to compliance policies

---

## Security Impact

When combined with:

* **Device Compliance Policies**
* **Conditional Access**

These notifications:

* Reduce helpdesk tickets
* Improve remediation speed
* Increase user accountability
* Strengthen Zero Trust enforcement

---
