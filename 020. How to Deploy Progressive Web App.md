# Lecture Notes: Deploying Progressive Web Apps (PWA) to Microsoft Edge Using Intune

## Overview

* **Topic:** Deploying **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** to Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 using Microsoft Intune
* **Use Case:** Provide native-app–like access to web applications with centralized management
* **Result:** PWAs are silently installed, pinned, and managed through Intune policies

## Benefits of PWA Deployment with Intune

* Centralized deployment and control
* No user interaction required
* Users cannot uninstall PWAs deployed by policy
* Shortcuts can be created on:

  * Start menu
  * Taskbar
  * Desktop
* Ideal for SaaS apps like Outlook, internal portals, dashboards
