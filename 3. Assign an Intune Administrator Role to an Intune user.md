# Assigning the Intune Administrator Directory Role to an Existing User

## Introduction

This session explains how to assign the **Intune Administrator directory role** to an existing Intune user account. Directory roles define the set of permissions granted to users within Microsoft Intune and Azure Active Directory.

Roles determine what actions a user can perform, such as managing devices, configuring policies, or administering Intune settings.

## Understanding Directory Roles in Intune

* A **directory role** defines permissions assigned to a user.
* Microsoft provides:

  * **Built-in roles** for common Intune scenarios
  * **Custom roles** that can be created with specific, granular permissions
* Built-in roles are sufficient for most administrative use cases.
* Roles can be managed using:

  * Azure Active Directory Admin Center
  * Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center

In this demonstration, the **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center** is used.
