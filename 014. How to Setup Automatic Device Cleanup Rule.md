# Lecture Notes: Configuring Automatic Device Cleanup Rules in Microsoft Intune

## Overview

* **Topic:** Setting up **Automatic Device Cleanup Rules** in Microsoft Intune
* **Use Case:** Automatically removing inactive or stale devices to keep Intune data clean and accurate
* **Result:** Improved reporting accuracy and reduced clutter from non-responsive devices

---

## Why Device Cleanup Rules Are Needed

* Over time, Intune accumulates:

  * Inactive devices
  * Stale or unresponsive records
* These devices:

  * Skew reports
  * Complicate administration
  * Reduce visibility of active assets

**Device Cleanup Rules** automate the removal of such devices based on inactivity.

---

## What Is a Device Cleanup Rule?

* A rule that automatically deletes **inactive devices** from Intune
* Inactivity is measured by **last check-in time**
* Devices that do not check in within a defined time frame are removed

---

## Cleanup Rule Parameters

### Supported Time Range

* Minimum: **30 days**
* Maximum: **270 days**
* Any value outside this range:

  * Cannot be saved
  * Intune enforces validation automatically

---

### Recommended Practice

* **90 days** is commonly recommended

  * Covers long leaves or vacations
  * Avoids premature deletion
* Final value depends on organizational policy

---

## Admin Portal Used

* **Portal:** Microsoft Endpoint Manager
* **URL:** `https://endpoint.microsoft.com`

---

## Step-by-Step: Enable Device Cleanup Rule

### Navigation

1. Sign in to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center**
2. Go to **Devices**
3. Scroll down to **Other**
4. Click **Device cleanup rules**

---

### Enable the Rule

* By default, the rule is **Disabled**
* Select **Yes** to enable

---

### Configure Inactivity Threshold

1. Enter number of inactive days

   * Example: **90**
2. Validation behavior:

   * Less than 30 → ❌ Not allowed
   * More than 270 → ❌ Not allowed

---

### Save the Rule

1. Click **Save**
2. Review warning:

   * Devices inactive beyond the threshold will be deleted
3. Click **Yes** to confirm

---

## Viewing Affected Devices (Important Step)

### Purpose

* Validate which devices will be deleted **before enabling cleanup**

---

### Steps

1. Click **View affected devices**
2. Review list of:

   * Devices inactive beyond configured days
3. Confirm these devices are safe to remove

> If no devices appear, none currently meet the inactivity criteria.

---

## Rule Execution Behavior

* After enabling:

  * Intune runs a **background cleanup job**
  * Job executes every **few hours**
* Devices exceeding the inactivity threshold are:

  * Automatically deleted from Intune
* Cleanup continues continuously as devices age out

---

## Reporting Impact

* Reports related to deleted devices:

  * May take up to **48 hours** to refresh
* This delay is expected and normal

---

## Important Limitation (Critical)

### Scope of Cleanup Rule

* Cleanup applies **only to Intune**
* Devices are **NOT removed** from:

  * Azure Active Directory

---

### Azure AD Cleanup Requirement

* To permanently remove stale devices:

  * Azure AD tenant admin must clean up devices separately
  * Intune cleanup ≠ Azure AD cleanup

---

## Key Takeaways

* Device Cleanup Rules automate stale device removal
* Helps maintain:

  * Accurate inventory
  * Clean reporting
* Rules are:

  * Enforced between 30–270 days
  * Continuously evaluated
* Always review **affected devices** before enabling
* Azure AD cleanup must be handled separately

---

## Summary

* Automatic device cleanup keeps Intune environments healthy
* Reduces administrative overhead
* Prevents reporting inaccuracies
* Best practice for medium and large environments
* Should be reviewed periodically alongside Azure AD cleanup processes

---

## Open Questions / Further Study

* Coordinating Intune cleanup with Azure AD cleanup
* Impact of cleanup on compliance history
* Cleanup behavior for Autopilot devices
* Using Graph API for custom cleanup reporting
