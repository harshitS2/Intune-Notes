# Lecture Notes: Changing the Primary User of a Device in Intune

## Overview

* **Topic:** Changing or removing the **Primary User** of a device in Microsoft Intune
* **Use Case:** Reassigning a device to a different user or converting it into a shared device
* **Result:** Correct license mapping, accurate user-device association, and improved device lifecycle management

---

## Key Concepts

### Primary User in Intune

* The **Primary User** maps an Intune-licensed user to a device
* An Intune-managed device can have:

  * **Zero (0)** primary users
  * **One (1)** primary user only

---

### Shared Device Definition

* If **no primary user** is assigned:

  * The device is treated as a **shared device**
* Common in:

  * Kiosk devices
  * Shift-based or pooled devices

---

### Automatic Assignment

* The primary user is **automatically assigned** during:

  * Initial Intune enrollment
* The assigned primary user can be **changed later by an administrator**

---

## Important Distinction

* **Primary User ≠ Enrolled By User**
* Changing the primary user:

  * **Does NOT** change the *Enrolled By* user
  * Enrollment history remains unchanged

---

## Admin Portal Used

* **Portal:** Microsoft Endpoint Manager
* **URL:** `https://endpoint.microsoft.com`

---

## Step-by-Step: Change Primary User

### Navigation

1. Sign in to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center**
2. Go to **Devices**
3. Select **All devices**
4. Click the target **Windows 10 device**
5. Under **Manage**, select **Properties**

---

### Current State

* **Primary User:** Test User 2

---

### Change Primary User

1. Click **Change primary user**
2. Select **Test User 3**
3. Click **Select**
4. Click **Save**

---

### Confirmation

* Message displayed: **Device property is saved successfully**
* Updated value visible under **Primary User**

---

### Verification

1. Go to **Overview** tab
2. Confirm:

   * **Primary User:** Test User 3

> ⏳ Changes may take **up to 10 minutes** to reflect across:
>
> * Intune
> * Azure Active Directory

---

## Removing the Primary User (Shared Device Scenario)

### Use Case

* Convert a user-assigned device into a **shared device**

---

### Steps

1. Go to **Devices → All devices**
2. Select the device
3. Under **Properties**
4. Click **Remove primary user**
5. Click **Save**

---

### Result

* Primary user is removed
* Device status becomes:

  * **Shared device**
* No user-license association remains

---

## Key Takeaways

* Each Intune device supports **only one primary user**
* Removing the primary user converts the device into a **shared device**
* Changing primary user:

  * Updates license mapping
  * Does not affect enrollment history
* Sync delays of up to **10 minutes** are normal

---

## Summary

* Primary user management is essential for:

  * License compliance
  * Accurate reporting
  * Device reassignment
* Intune allows administrators to:

  * Change primary user
  * Remove primary user entirely
* This flexibility supports both **user-based** and **shared-device** models

---

## Open Questions / Further Study

* Automating primary user changes using Graph API
* Primary user behavior in DEM-enrolled devices
* Impact of primary user on Conditional Access
* Best practices for shared device environments
