# Lecture Notes: Deploying an MSI Application to Windows 10 Using Microsoft Intune (LOB App)

## Overview

* **Topic:** Deploying an **MSI-based application** to Windows 10 using Microsoft Intune
* **Deployment Type:** **Line-of-Business (LOB) App**
* **Example Used:** Google Chrome (MSI installer)
* **Target OS:** Windows 10
* **Result:** Application is automatically installed on Intune-managed devices

---

## Understanding App Deployment Options in Intune

Microsoft Intune supports multiple application deployment methods for Windows devices, including:

* Microsoft Store apps
* Web apps
* Line-of-Business (LOB) apps
* Win32 apps (recommended for advanced scenarios)

This video focuses on **LOB app deployment using an MSI installer**.

---

## What Is a Line-of-Business (LOB) App?

* Legacy app deployment method in Intune
* Uses the **built-in Windows MDM agent**
* Supports **single installer files** only:

  * `.msi`
  * `.msix`
  * `.appx`
* **Limitations:**

  * Does NOT support:

    * MSI + MST (transform) files
    * Complex installation logic
    * Dependencies
* Intended for **simple MSI-based installations**

> ⚠️ For advanced deployment scenarios, **Win32 app deployment** should be used instead.

---

## Step 7: Client-Side Deployment (Windows 10)

### Manual Sync (Recommended)

1. On Windows 10 device:

   * Go to **Settings → Accounts**
   * **Access work or school**
   * Click **Info → Sync**
2. Restart the device

---

### Verification on Device

* Desktop shortcut for **Google Chrome** appears
* Launch Chrome successfully
* Application installs silently

---

### Installed Programs Check

1. Open **Run**
2. Type `appwiz.cpl`
3. Confirm:

   * Google Chrome installed
   * Installation date and version visible

---

## Step 8: Monitoring Deployment in Intune

### App-Level Monitoring

1. Go to **Apps → Windows apps**
2. Select **Google Chrome**
3. Under **Monitor**, click:

   * **Device install status**

---

### Device-Level Monitoring (Recommended)

1. Go to **Devices → Windows**
2. Select the target device
3. Under **Monitor**, click **Managed apps**
4. Confirm:

   * Installation status: **Installed**
   * Assignment type: **Required**
   * Timestamps:

     * App created
     * App assigned
     * Installation completed

> Device-level monitoring provides **more accurate status** than app-level view.
