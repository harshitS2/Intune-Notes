# Lecture Notes: Managing Device Categories in Intune (Assign, Rename, Delete)

## Overview

* **Topic:** Creating, assigning, renaming, and deleting **Device Categories** in Microsoft Intune
* **Use Case:** Correcting device categorization issues and maintaining accurate Dynamic Azure AD device groups
* **Result:** Improved control over device grouping, policy targeting, and lifecycle management

---

## Background Context

* In the previous session:

  * Device categories were created
  * Dynamic device groups were built based on those categories
* Device categories simplify:

  * Group-based deployments
  * Policy and app targeting

However, practical challenges arise when:

* Devices are **Hybrid Azure AD Joined**
* Devices are enrolled **without category selection**
* End users select the **wrong category**

This session focuses on **managing device categories after enrollment**.

---

## Key Challenges with Device Categories

### Enrollment Limitations

* **Hybrid Azure AD Joined Windows devices**

  * Do **not** prompt for device category during enrollment
* **macOS and iOS devices**

  * Also lack category selection at enrollment

### User Dependency Risk

* Category selection is user-driven for:

  * Azure AD Joined devices
  * Azure AD Registered devices
* This approach is **not error-free**

> Admins should provide **clear guidance or documentation** to help users select the correct category.

---

## Administrative Capabilities Covered

In this session, we learn how to:

✔ Create new device categories
✔ Manually assign a category to an existing device
✔ Rename an existing device category
✔ Delete a device category
✔ Understand impact on Dynamic device groups

---

## Admin Portal Used

* **Portal:** Microsoft Endpoint Manager
* **URL:** `https://endpoint.microsoft.com`

---

## Step 1: Create a New Device Category

### Navigation

1. Go to **Devices**
2. Scroll down
3. Under **Other**, select **Device categories**

---

### Create Category

1. Click **Create device category**

2. Under **Basics**:

   * **Name:** Sales Team
   * **Description:** Devices from the Sales department

3. Click **Next**

4. **Scope tags:** Default

5. Review and click **Create**

---

### Result

* Confirmation message displayed
* Category appears in **Device categories** list

---

## Step 2: Manually Assign a Device Category to a Device

### Scenario

* A **Windows 10 device** has no category assigned
* Goal: Assign **Sales Team** category

---

### Steps

1. Go to **Devices → All devices**

2. Select the **Windows 10 device**

3. Under **Manage**, click **Properties**

4. Locate **Device category**

   * Current value: **Unassigned**

5. Select **Sales Team** from dropdown

6. Click **Save**

---

### Outcome

* Confirmation message displayed
* Device category updated successfully
* If a Dynamic group exists for this category:

  * Device is **automatically added** to that group

---

## Step 3: Rename an Existing Device Category

### Scenario

* Rename **Sales Team** → **Sales and Marketing Team**

---

### Steps

1. Go to **Devices → Device categories**

2. Select **Sales Team**

3. Click **Edit**

4. Update:

   * **Name:** Sales and Marketing Team
   * **Description:** Devices from Sales and Marketing department

5. Click **Review + Save**

6. Click **Save**

---

### Important Behavior

* Renaming a category:

  * Automatically updates **all devices** assigned to it
  * No manual reassignment required

---

### Verification

1. Go to **Devices → All devices**
2. Select the previously updated Windows 10 device
3. Under **Properties**, confirm:

   * **Device category:** Sales and Marketing Team

---

## Step 4: Delete a Device Category

### Scenario

* Delete **Sales and Marketing Team** category

---

### Expected Impact

* Devices assigned to this category will:

  * Become **Unassigned**
  * Temporarily appear **blank** in some cases

---

### Steps

1. Go to **Devices → Device categories**
2. Click **three dots (⋮)** next to **Sales and Marketing Team**
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion

---

### Confirmation

* Message displayed: Device category deleted successfully

---

### Post-Deletion Verification

1. Go to **Devices → All devices**
2. Select the Windows 10 device
3. Under **Properties**, confirm:

   * **Device category:** Unassigned

---

## Key Takeaways

* Device categories can be **managed after enrollment**
* Admins can:

  * Correct user mistakes
  * Maintain clean Dynamic groups
* Renaming categories:

  * Automatically updates all assigned devices
* Deleting categories:

  * Sets affected devices to **Unassigned**
* Dynamic groups react automatically to category changes

---

## Summary

* Device categories are central to structured Intune management
* Manual assignment resolves enrollment limitations
* Renaming categories is safe and non-disruptive
* Deleting categories removes group association cleanly
* Proper category governance improves deployment accuracy

---

## Open Questions / Further Study

* Bulk updating device categories using Graph API
* Enforcing category selection during enrollment
* Combining device category with:

  * OS filters
  * Ownership filters
* Auditing incorrect user-selected categories
