# Lecture Notes: Creating a Dynamic Group for All Windows 10 Devices Managed by Intune

## Overview

* **Topic:** Creating a **Dynamic Device Group** in Azure Active Directory for Windows 10 devices managed by Intune
* **Use Case:** Automatically group Windows 10 devices for policy deployment and management
* **Result:** Group membership updates automatically based on device attributes

---

## Key Concepts

### Azure AD Groups in Intune

* Groups are used to organize **users and devices** for management
* Common grouping criteria include:

  * Department
  * Location
  * Hardware type

### Types of Groups

* **Assigned Group**

  * Members added manually
  * Static membership

* **Dynamic Group**

  * Uses **attribute-based rules**
  * Membership updates **automatically**
  * Managed in **Azure Active Directory**

### Important Requirement

* **Azure AD Premium license is required** for Dynamic Groups

---

## Objective of This Session

Create a **Dynamic Device Group** that includes:

✔ All Windows devices
✔ Running **Windows 10**
✔ Managed by **Intune (MDM)**

---

## Environment Used

* Portal: **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center**
* URL: `https://endpoint.microsoft.com`
* Devices in environment:

  * 2 × Windows 10
  * 1 × Windows 11

Only **Windows 10 Intune-managed devices** should be included in the group.

---

## Step-by-Step: Creating the Dynamic Group

### 1. Open Intune Admin Center

1. Sign in to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center**
2. Go to **Devices**
3. Select **Windows**
4. Review currently managed devices

---

### 2. Create a New Group

1. Go to **Groups**
2. Click **New Group**
3. Configure:

   * **Group Type:** Security
   * **Name:** `Intune_Win10_Client`
   * **Description:** Only Windows 10 devices managed by Intune
   * **Membership Type:** Dynamic Device

---

### 3. Define Dynamic Membership Rule

Click **Add dynamic query**

#### Rule Conditions

You will use **three expressions** joined with **AND**.

---

### Condition 1 — Windows Operating System

* **Property:** deviceOSType
* **Operator:** Equals
* **Value:** `Windows`

This filters **Windows devices only**

---

### Condition 2 — Windows 10 Version

* **Property:** deviceOSVersion
* **Operator:** Starts With
* **Value:** `10.0.1`

This identifies **Windows 10 builds**

---

### Condition 3 — Intune Management Type

* **Property:** managementType
* **Operator:** Equals
* **Value:** `MDM`

This ensures the device is **Intune-managed**

---

### Example Rule Logic (Summary)

The device must:

✔ Be a Windows OS
✔ Be Windows 10
✔ Be managed by Intune

---

### 4. Save and Create

* Save dynamic query
* Click **Create**

The group is now created and **membership evaluation starts automatically**

---

## Membership Processing

* Processing may take **several hours**
* Status fields include:

  * Dynamic rule processing status
  * Last membership change

Initially:

* No members appear
* Status may show **Not available**

Later:

* Status updates to **Update completed**
* Devices are added automatically

---

## Final Verification

### Check Group Members

1. Open the group
2. Select **Members**

You should see:

✔ Only Windows 10 devices
✔ Managed by Intune
✔ Matching rule criteria

Windows 11 devices are **not included**

---

## Key Takeaways

* Dynamic groups automate device grouping

* Membership updates without admin intervention

* Excellent for:

  * Policy targeting
  * Compliance assignment
  * App deployment

* Requirements:

  * Azure AD Premium licensing
  * Correct rule logic

* The rule filters by:

  ✔ OS Type
  ✔ OS Version
  ✔ Management Type

---

## Summary

* Dynamic Groups allow **attribute-based membership**
* Ideal for **Intune device management**
* The created group:

  ✔ Includes Windows 10 devices
  ✔ Managed by Intune
  ✔ Updates automatically

This streamlines device targeting and reduces administrative effort.
