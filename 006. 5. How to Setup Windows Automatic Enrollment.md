# Lecture Notes: Setting Up Windows Automatic Enrollment in Microsoft Intune

## Overview

* **Topic:** Configuring Windows automatic enrollment in Microsoft Intune
* **Purpose:** Automatically enroll Windows devices into Intune when users sign in with work credentials.
* **Key Benefit:** Ensures device visibility, management, compliance, and policy enforcement.
* **Core Concept:** Automatic enrollment is controlled by **MDM (Mobile Device Management) user scope**.

---

## Key Concepts

* **Automatic Enrollment**

  * Devices are enrolled into Intune automatically when users sign in with work or school credentials.
  * Can occur during:

    * Initial device setup
    * Adding a work account to an existing device
* **Why It Matters**

  * Centralized device management
  * Policy and compliance enforcement
  * Visibility into devices used for work

---

## Step 1: Access Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center

* Navigate to:
  **[https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)**
* This is the central portal for managing Intune and device enrollment.

---

## Step 2: Configure MDM and MAM User Scope

> ⚠️ *These settings affect **all devices**, not only Windows, even though they are configured under Windows enrollment.*

### Navigation Path

* Home → **Devices**
* **Device enrollment** → **Enroll devices**
* **Windows enrollment**
* **General** → **Automatic enrollment**

### MDM & MAM Scope Configuration

* Options:

  * **None** (not configured)
  * **Some** – enroll only selected Azure AD groups
  * **All** – enroll all users automatically

### Using “Some” (Targeted Enrollment)

* Recommended for:

  * Testing
  * Pilot deployments
  * Limited user enrollment
* Steps:

  * Select **Some**
  * Click **No group selected**
  * Choose an Azure AD group (example: *MDM Test Group 1*)
  * Click **Select** → **Save**
* Confirmation message indicates successful update.

**Important Note**

* A device will only auto-enroll if the **signed-in user is a member of the targeted group**.

---

## Step 3: Optional – CNAME for Simplified Enrollment

* Used when:

  * You have a **custom domain**
  * You want Windows enrollment without Azure AD Premium
* Requires:

  * Creating a **DNS CNAME record** that redirects enrollment requests to the Intune server
* Not applicable when using the default `onmicrosoft.com` domain.

---

## Step 4: Verify Licensing Requirements

### Intune Licensing Rules

* Users must:

  * Have an **Intune license**
  * Have the **Intune service enabled** in their license
* Automatic enrollment will fail without proper licensing.

### Verification Example

* User: *Test User 2*
* Confirm:

  * Membership in **MDM Test Group 1**
  * Assigned license: **Enterprise Mobility + Security E5**
  * Intune service enabled within the license

### Tip

* You can create a **dynamic Azure AD group**:

  * Automatically includes users who are licensed for Intune
  * Ensures enrollment scope stays up to date

---

## Step 5: Test Automatic Enrollment (Windows 10)

### Environment

* Windows 10 Virtual Machine
* Version: **21H1**

### Join Device to Azure Active Directory

1. Start Menu → **Settings**
2. **Accounts**
3. **Access work or school**
4. **Connect**
5. **Join this device to Azure Active Directory**
6. Sign in using Azure AD credentials (e.g., Test User 2)

#### Authentication Notes

* If MFA is enabled:

  * Complete MFA before device joins Azure AD
* Confirm:

  * Organization name
  * Username
  * Domain
* Click **Join** to start enrollment

---

## Step 6: First Sign-In and User Setup

* Sign out of local account
* Sign in with work/school account
* First login actions:

  * User profile creation
  * Windows Hello setup (PIN)
  * Identity verification via OTP (if required)

---

## Step 7: Verify Enrollment on the Device

### On Windows 10

* Settings → **Accounts**
* **Access work or school**
* Select connected account → **Info**
* Confirm:

  * Organization name
  * Managed by organization
  * Last successful sync time
* Manual sync option available

---

## Step 8: Verify Enrollment in Intune Portal

### Microsoft Endpoint Manager

* **Devices** → **All devices**
* Locate the enrolled Windows 10 device
* Verify:

  * **Managed by:** Intune
  * **Ownership:** Corporate
  * **Compliance:** Compliant
  * **Primary user:** Correct UPN
  * **OS version and device name** match the VM

---

## Summary of Key Points

* Automatic enrollment simplifies Intune deployment and device management.
* Enrollment is controlled by **MDM user scope** (All vs. Some).
* Users must:

  * Be part of the targeted Azure AD group
  * Have a valid Intune license
* Enrollment is triggered when a user joins or signs into a Windows device with work credentials.
* Successful enrollment can be verified:

  * Locally on the device
  * In Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center

## Open Questions / Areas for Further Study

* Differences between **MDM** and **MAM** scopes in mixed device environments
* Impact of automatic enrollment on BYOD scenarios
* Best practices for dynamic group creation and licensing strategies
* Troubleshooting failed automatic enrollment cases
