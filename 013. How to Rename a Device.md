# Lecture Notes: Renaming a Device in Microsoft Intune

## Overview

* **Topic:** Renaming an enrolled device using Microsoft Intune
* **Use Case:** Assigning meaningful, standardized device names for easier identification and management
* **Result:** Device name is updated both in Intune and on the physical Windows device

---

## Key Concepts

### Device Rename in Intune

* Intune allows administrators to **remotely rename devices**
* Renaming updates:

  * Device name in Intune portal
  * Computer name on the actual device
* Action can optionally **restart the device automatically**

---

### Common Use Cases

* Devices enrolled with default names like:

  * `DESKTOP-XXXXXX`
* Devices provisioned using **Windows Autopilot**

  * Autopilot assigns names based on profile
  * Admin may later need to rename specific devices
* Easier identification in:

  * Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center
  * Inventory and reporting

---

## Admin Portal Used

* **Portal:** Microsoft Endpoint Manager
* **URL:** `https://endpoint.microsoft.com`

---

## Naming Rules and Guidelines

When renaming a device:

✔ Allowed:

* Letters (A–Z)
* Numbers (0–9)
* Hyphens (-)

❌ Not allowed:

* Spaces
* Special characters

**Example valid name:**
`LAB-WIN10-PC01`

---

## Ways to Rename a Device

There are **two methods** to rename a device in Intune:

1. **From Properties**
2. **From Overview (Three-dot menu)**

Both methods open the **same Rename Device pane**.

---

## Step-by-Step: Rename a Device

### Navigation

1. Sign in to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center**
2. Go to **Devices**
3. Click **All devices**
4. Select the target **Windows 10 device**

---

### Method 1: Rename via Properties

1. Under **Manage**, click **Properties**
2. Select **Rename device**

---

### Method 2: Rename via Overview

1. Stay on **Overview** tab
2. Click **Three dots (⋮)**
3. Select **Rename device**

---

## Rename Configuration

1. Enter the **new device name**

   * Example: `LAB-WIN10-PC01`
2. Choose **Restart after rename**:

   * **Yes** – Device restarts automatically
   * **No** – Restart manually later
3. Click **Rename**

---

## Action Status Tracking

* After initiating rename:

  * Status shows **Pending**
* Two actions appear:

  * Rename device
  * Restart device

You can track progress under:

* **Device → Device action status**

---

## Device-Side Verification

### Before Rename

* Device name shown as:

  * `DESKTOP-XXXXXX`

---

### Sync with Intune (Optional but Recommended)

1. On the device:

   * **Settings → Accounts**
   * **Access work or school**
   * Click **Info**
   * Select **Sync**

This speeds up policy and action processing.

---

### Restart and Update

* Device prompts user before restart
* After restart:

  * Old name is removed
  * New name is applied system-wide

---

## Post-Rename Verification

### On Device

1. Right-click **Start**
2. Click **System**
3. Confirm:

   * New device name is visible

---

### In Intune Admin Center

1. Refresh **All devices** page
2. Confirm:

   * Device name updated
   * Device action status:

     * Rename: **Completed**
     * Restart: **Completed**

---

## Key Takeaways

* Intune supports **remote device renaming**
* Changes reflect both:

  * On the device
  * In the admin portal
* Manual sync can accelerate processing
* Restart is required for rename to fully apply
* Ideal for standardizing device naming conventions

---

## Summary

* Device renaming is simple and effective in Intune
* Helps improve visibility and administration
* Especially useful after:

  * Autopilot provisioning
  * Bulk device enrollment
* Admins can monitor action status to confirm success

---

## Open Questions / Further Study

* Renaming devices using Configuration Profiles
* Using dynamic variables in device naming
* Naming standards for large environments
* Automating rename operations with Graph API
