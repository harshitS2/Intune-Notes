# Lecture Notes: Manually Enrolling Windows 10 into Intune (MDM Only)

## Overview

* **Topic:** Manual enrollment of Windows 10 into Microsoft Intune using **Enroll only in device management**
* **Use Case:** Enroll a device in Intune **without** Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) join or registration
* **Result:** Device is managed by Intune MDM only and treated as a **personal (BYOD) device**

---

## Key Concepts

* **Enroll Only in Device Management**

  * Enrolls the device **only into Intune MDM**
  * Does **not**:

    * Azure AD Join
    * Azure AD Register the device
  * Device appears:

    * ✅ In **Intune (Endpoint Manager)**
    * ❌ Not fully in **Azure AD Devices**

* **Device Classification**

  * Ownership: **Personal**
  * Commonly used for **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** scenarios

---

## Capabilities and Limitations

### What You Can Do

* Push **MDM policies** from Intune
* View:

  * Compliance state
  * OS and version
  * Last check-in time
  * Primary user

### Limitations

* Device is **not Azure AD joined**
* **Conditional Access policies will not apply**

  * Conditional Access requires Azure AD joined or registered devices
* Azure AD Admin Center shows **very limited device information**

> ⚠️ This method may create issues in the future due to lack of Azure AD registration.

---

## Scenario Demonstrated

* **OS:** Windows 10
* **Version:** 21H1
* **User:** Test User 3
* **Enrollment Type:** Intune MDM only (Enroll only in device management)

---

## Step-by-Step: Manual Enrollment (MDM Only)

### On Windows 10 Device

1. Click **Start Menu**
2. Open **Settings**
3. Select **Accounts**
4. Click **Access work or school**
5. Under **Related settings**, click:

   * **Enroll only in device management**

---

### Authentication Process

* Enter **Azure AD user credentials**

  * Example: `user3@msfsurat.onmicrosoft.com`
* Enter password
* Approve sign-in prompt
* Enrollment completes successfully

---

## Verifying Enrollment on the Device

### Access Enrollment Information

* Settings → **Accounts**
* **Access work or school**
* Select the connected account
* Click **Info**

### Confirm:

* Managed by organization (Intune)
* Connected via MDM
* Device sync status

### Recommended Action

* Click **Sync** to immediately synchronize the device with Intune
* Confirm successful sync with timestamp

---

## Verifying Device in Microsoft Intune

### Endpoint Manager Admin Center

* Navigate to:

  * **Devices** → **All devices**
* Device may take **1–2 minutes** to appear

### Observations

* Device name visible
* **Managed by:** Intune
* **Ownership:** Personal
* Additional details:

  * Compliance state
  * OS and version
  * Last check-in time
  * Primary user UPN

---

## Verifying Device in Azure AD Admin Center

### Navigation

* Go to **Azure Active Directory Admin Center**
* **Azure Active Directory** → **Devices** → **All devices**

### Device Status in Azure AD

* Device appears with:

  * **Join type:** Blank
  * **Owner:** None
  * **Registration date:** Not available
  * **Compliance state:** Not available

### Comparison

| Feature           | Azure AD Admin Center | Intune Admin Center |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Device compliance | ❌ Not visible         | ✅ Visible           |
| Last check-in     | ❌ Not visible         | ✅ Visible           |
| Ownership         | ❌ Not visible         | ✅ Personal          |
| MDM status        | ❌ Limited             | ✅ Full              |

## Key Takeaways

* **Enroll only in device management**:

  * Enrolls device into Intune without Azure AD join
  * Best suited for **BYOD scenarios**
* **Major drawback**:

  * No Conditional Access support
  * Limited visibility in Azure AD
* **All management and compliance data** is available in:

  * **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center**
* This method should be used **carefully**, as it may cause management limitations later.

---

## Summary

* Manual MDM-only enrollment is possible and functional
* Device is managed by Intune but invisible to Azure AD controls
* Useful for testing or limited BYOD management
* Not recommended for environments relying on Conditional Access or full Azure AD integration

---

## Open Questions / Further Study

* When to choose MDM-only vs Azure AD join
* Conditional Access alternatives for BYOD devices
* Long-term management implications of personal device ownership
* Security trade-offs of non–Azure AD joined devices
