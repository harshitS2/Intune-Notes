# Creating a Group in Microsoft Intune and Assigning Group-Based Intune Licenses

## Introduction

This session explains how to create a group to manage users in Microsoft Intune and then assign an Intune license to that group using the Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center. Groups in Intune are used to manage users, devices, and control employee access to company resources efficiently.

Intune uses Azure Active Directory groups to manage users and devices. Group-based management simplifies policy assignment, license allocation, and access control.

## Understanding Groups in Intune

Groups are used to:

* Manage users and devices
* Control access to corporate resources
* Assign policies, apps, and licenses efficiently

When assigning policies in Intune, you can target:

* **All Users**
* **All Devices**
* **Azure Active Directory Groups**

The **All Users** and **All Devices** groups are pre-created, virtual groups:

* **All Devices** targets every device enrolled in Intune
* **All Users** targets all users assigned an Intune license

These groups are virtual because:

* They are not created or visible in Azure Active Directory
* They exist automatically in the tenant
* They provide faster targeting than custom Azure AD groups

Apart from these, custom groups can be created based on organizational requirements.

## Methods to Create and Manage Groups

Groups can be created and managed using:

* Microsoft 365 Admin Center
* Azure Active Directory Admin Center
* Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center

In this demonstration, a **Security Group** is created using the **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center**.

---

## Accessing Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center

1. Open a web browser.
2. Navigate to:
   [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)
3. Sign in using an administrator account.

---

## Navigating to Groups

1. On the home page, click **Groups**.
2. The Groups page displays existing groups in the tenant.
3. In this case, no groups exist initially.

---

## Creating a New Group

1. Click the **New group (+)** icon.
2. On the group creation page, select:

   * **Group type**: Security
3. Enter the following details:

   * **Group name**: MDM Test Group 1
   * **Group description**: Test group 1

---

## Group Membership Types

Intune supports two membership types:

* **Assigned (Static)** – Users or devices are manually added
* **Dynamic** – Membership is automatically updated based on rules

In this video:

* Membership type is set to **Assigned** (default)
* Dynamic groups are mentioned and will be covered in later videos

---

## Adding Members to the Group

1. Under **Members**, click **No members selected**.
2. From the list of users, select:

   * Test User2
   * Test User3
3. Click **Select**.
4. Confirm that two members are selected.
5. Click **Create**.

Wait for the confirmation message indicating the group has been successfully created.

---

## Managing the Group

After creation:

1. Click **Refresh** to update the group list.
2. The group **MDM Test Group 1** is now visible and ready for management.

You can manage group settings if required:

* Edit group name
* Edit description
* Change membership type

---

## Viewing Group Members

1. Click on **MDM Test Group 1**.
2. Under **Manage**, select **Members**.
3. The members **Test User2** and **Test User3** are listed.
4. Members can be added or removed as needed.

---

## Editing Group Properties

1. Under **Manage**, click **Properties**.
2. From here, you can update:

   * Group name
   * Group description
   * Membership type
   * Other general settings
3. Close the properties page after review.

---

## Assigning Intune Licenses Using Groups

For small environments, licenses can be assigned directly to individual users.
For larger environments, **group-based license assignment** is the recommended and scalable approach.

In this scenario:

* The Intune license is assigned to **MDM Test Group 1**
* All group members automatically inherit the license
* Members include **Test User2** and **Test User3**

---

## Assigning the License to the Group

1. Select **MDM Test Group 1**.
2. Under **Manage**, click **Licenses**.
3. Click **Assignments**.
4. In the license section, select:

   * **Enterprise Mobility + Security E5**
5. Ensure **Intune** is selected.
6. Adjust license options if required based on subscription.
7. Click **Save**.

Wait for the confirmation message indicating assignments to members succeeded.

---

## Verifying Group License Assignment

* The **Enterprise Mobility + Security E5** license now shows:

  * Assigned
  * State: Active

---

## Checking License Status for Users

To confirm inheritance:

### Test User2

1. Go to **Users**.
2. Select **Test User2**.
3. Under **Manage**, click **Licenses**.
4. Initially, no license may appear.
5. Refresh the page.
6. The **Enterprise Mobility + Security E5** license appears as active.

Important detail:

* **Assignment Path** shows the license is inherited from **MDM Test Group 1**

### Test User3

* Repeat the same steps.
* The result is identical.
* License is inherited from the group.

---

## Summary

* A security group **MDM Test Group 1** was successfully created.
* Users **Test User2** and **Test User3** were added to the group.
* An Intune license was assigned at the group level.
* License inheritance automatically applied to all group members.
* Group-based licensing ensures scalability and simplified management.

## Conclusion

This completes the process of creating a group to manage users in Microsoft Intune and assigning group-based Intune licenses using the Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center.
