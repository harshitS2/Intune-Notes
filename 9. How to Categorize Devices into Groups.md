# Lecture Notes: Creating Device Categories and Dynamic Device Groups in Intune

## Overview

* **Topic:** Creating **Device Categories** in Microsoft Intune and using them to build **Dynamic Azure AD Security Groups**
* **Use Case:** Automatically group devices based on department or function during enrollment
* **Result:** Devices are dynamically added to Azure AD groups and can receive targeted policies and applications

---

## Key Concepts

### Device Categories in Intune

* Device categories help **classify and organize devices**

* Common examples:

  * HR
  * Accounting
  * Finance
  * IT

* Categories are selected by **end users during device enrollment**

---

### Benefits of Device Categories

* Enable creation of **Dynamic Azure AD Security Groups**

* Automatically assign:

  * Policies
  * Applications
  * Configurations

* Reduce manual device grouping effort

---

### Important Limitation

* Device category selection depends on **end users**
* This method is **not 100% error-free**
* Admins should:

  * Provide clear documentation
  * Guide users to select the correct category during enrollment

---

## Tools Used

* **Admin Portal:** Microsoft Endpoint Manager
* **Directory Service:** Azure Active Directory

---

## Step 1: Create a Device Category in Intune

### Access Admin Center

1. Sign in to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center**
2. Navigate to **Devices**
3. Scroll down
4. Under **Other**, select **Device categories**

---

### Create New Device Category

1. Click **Create device category**

2. Under **Basics**:

   * **Name:** HR Team
   * **Description:** Devices from the HR department

3. Click **Next**

4. **Scope tags:** Default (no custom tags)

5. Review and click **Create**

---

### Confirmation

* Message displayed: **Device category successfully created**
* Category appears in the **Device categories** list

---

## Step 2: Enroll a Windows 11 Device and Select Category

### Device Information

* **Device Name:** `Win11-CLI04`
* **OS:** Windows 11
* **Enrollment Method:** Company Portal app

---

### Enrollment Process

1. Open **Microsoft Store**
2. Search for **Company Portal**
3. Click **Get** and install
4. Launch **Company Portal**
5. Sign in using work account
6. Allow organization to manage the device
7. Complete:

   * OTP verification
   * PIN setup

---

### Device Category Selection

* During enrollment, user is prompted to select a **device category**
* Selected category: **HR Team**
* Click **Done**

➡ Device is now assigned to the selected category

---

## Step 3: Verify Device Category Assignment

### In Intune Admin Center

1. Go to **Devices → All devices**
2. Select device: `Win11-CLI04`
3. Navigate to **Properties**
4. Confirm:

   * **Device Category:** HR Team

---

## Step 4: Create Dynamic Device Group Using Device Category

### Create New Group

1. Go to **Groups**
2. Click **New group**
3. Configure:

   * **Group type:** Security
   * **Group name:** HR Team Devices
   * **Description:** All devices from HR team
   * **Membership type:** Dynamic device

---

### Define Dynamic Membership Rule

1. Click **Add dynamic query**
2. Configure rule:

   * **Property:** deviceCategory
   * **Operator:** Equals
   * **Value:** HR-Team

---

### Rule Syntax (Conceptual)

* Devices where **Device Category = HR Team**
* Only devices enrolled with this category are included

---

### Create Group

1. Save rule
2. Click **Create**
3. Confirmation message displayed

---

## Step 5: Dynamic Membership Processing

* Dynamic group evaluation can take **up to 24 hours**

* Initially:

  * No members shown
  * Processing status unavailable

* After processing:

  * Status: **Completed**
  * Membership updated automatically

---

## Final Verification

### Check Group Members

1. Open **HR Team Devices** group
2. Click **Members**

✔ Device `Win11-CLI04` appears
✔ Matches device category rule
✔ Membership added automatically

---

## Key Takeaways

* Device categories enable **department-based device grouping**

* Dynamic groups update **automatically** based on category

* Ideal for:

  * Policy assignment
  * App deployment
  * Department-based management

* Limitations:

  * Relies on correct user selection
  * Requires clear admin guidance

---

## Summary

* Device categories are created in Intune
* Users select category during enrollment
* Dynamic Azure AD groups use category as an attribute
* Devices are automatically grouped and managed
* Simplifies large-scale Intune deployments

---

## Open Questions / Further Study

* Enforcing device category selection via enrollment restrictions
* Combining device category with OS or ownership filters
* Handling incorrect user-selected categories
* Governance best practices for Dynamic Groups
