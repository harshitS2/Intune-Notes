# Lecture Notes: Microsoft Intune Device Enrollment Manager (DEM)

## Overview

* **Topic:** Adding and using a **Device Enrollment Manager (DEM)** account in entity["organization","Microsoft Intune","endpoint management service"]  
* **Use Case:** Bulk enrollment of devices without granting end users local administrator access  
* **Result:** Secure, scalable onboarding of corporate devices into Intune  

---

## What Is Device Enrollment Manager (DEM)?

### Definition

* A **Device Enrollment Manager (DEM)** is a **non-administrator user** who can enroll a large number of devices into Intune.

### Why DEM Is Needed

* Useful when:
  * Preparing devices in bulk
  * Staging devices before distribution to users
* Ideal for:
  * IT provisioning teams
  * Shared or kiosk-style device scenarios

---

## DEM vs Standard User Enrollment

| Feature | Standard User | DEM Account |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Max devices enrollable | 15 | 1000 |
| Local admin rights after enrollment | Yes | No (for end users) |
| Intended use | Personal / BYOD | Bulk corporate enrollment |

> ⚠️ Do not confuse **Intune Admin** and **DEM** accounts.  
> A DEM **cannot** be an Intune Administrator.

---

## DEM Requirements and Rules

### Licensing

* DEM user **must have**:
  * Intune User or Device license
  * Example: Enterprise Mobility + Security E5

### Account Prerequisites

* DEM accounts are **not created**
* Existing users are **promoted** to DEM
* User must already exist in Azure AD

---

## Security Advantage of DEM

### Standard Enrollment Behavior

* If a local admin enrolls a device:
  * That user retains **administrator access** on the device

### DEM Enrollment Behavior

* DEM enrolls the device
* End user signs in later
* End user **does not receive local admin access**

✔ This significantly improves device security

---

## Who Can Manage DEM Accounts?

Only the following roles can add or manage DEMs:

* Global Administrator  
* Intune Service Administrator  

---

## Admin Portal Used

* **Portal:** entity["organization","Microsoft Endpoint Manager","intune admin center"]  
* **URL:** `https://endpoint.microsoft.com`

---

## Step 1: Verify DEM User License

1. Go to **Users**
2. Select user (example: `testDEM`)
3. Under **Manage**, click **Licenses**
4. Confirm:
   * Intune license is assigned and active

---

## Step 2: Add Device Enrollment Manager

### Navigation

1. Go to **Devices**
2. Under **Device enrollment**, select **Enroll devices**
3. Click **Device enrollment managers**

---

### Add DEM User

1. Click **Add**
2. Paste DEM user UPN
3. Click **Add**

---

### Confirmation

* Message displayed: **Successfully promoted a user**
* User is now a **Device Enrollment Manager**

---

## DEM Limitations (Important)

### Functional Limitations

1. **Cannot wipe devices**
   * Only Intune Admins can wipe devices
   * Wipe must be done from Admin Center

2. **Shared device mode**
   * Windows 10/11 devices enrolled by DEM operate in shared mode
   * Default Intune device limits do not apply

3. **DEM Account Limits**
   * Maximum of **150 DEM accounts** per Intune tenant

---

## Step 3: Enroll Windows 10 Device Using DEM

### Device Information

* **OS:** Windows 10
* **Hostname:** `Win10-DEM`

---

### Enrollment Steps (On Device)

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Select **Accounts**
3. Click **Access work or school**
4. Click **Connect**
5. Choose **Join this device to Azure Active Directory**
6. Sign in using **DEM account credentials**
7. Confirm organization and click **Join**
8. Click **Done**

---

## Step 4: Verify Enrollment in Intune

### In Admin Center

1. Go to **Devices → All devices**
2. Confirm:
   * Device appears
   * Managed by Intune
   * Ownership: Corporate
   * Primary user: DEM account

---

## Step 5: Sign In as End User

### Scenario

* End user (`testuser2`) signs in after DEM enrollment

---

### Verification on Device

1. Open **Settings → Accounts**
2. Check **Access work or school**
3. Observe:
   * User cannot disconnect device
   * Admin options are unavailable

---

### Local Admin Confirmation

1. Open **Computer Management**
2. Go to **Local Users and Groups → Groups**
3. Open **Administrators**

✔ DEM account is listed  
❌ End user is not an administrator  

---

## Key Takeaways

* DEM enables **secure bulk device enrollment**
* End users do **not** get admin rights
* Ideal for corporate provisioning
* Requires:
  * Intune license
  * Pre-created Azure AD user
* DEM accounts have operational limits

---

## Summary

* DEM is a scalable and secure enrollment method
* Prevents unnecessary admin access for end users
* Supports corporate governance and compliance
* Best practice for IT-led device onboarding

---

## Open Questions / Further Study

* Bulk enrollment automation with Autopilot vs DEM
* DEM behavior with Windows Autopilot
* Combining DEM with enrollment restrictions
* Auditing DEM-enrolled devices
