# Creating a User Account in Microsoft Intune and Assigning a License

## Introduction

This session explains how to create a user account in Microsoft Intune and assign an Intune license to that user. Creating users and assigning licenses is a mandatory step to allow device enrollment and management through Intune.

To manage devices using Intune, users must exist in the tenant and use their credentials to sign in and enroll devices.

---

## Ways to Create Users in Intune Environment

Users can be created using multiple portals:

* Microsoft 365 Admin Center
* Azure Active Directory Admin Center
* Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center

Users can also be synchronized from on-premises Active Directory using the Azure AD Connect tool.
In this demonstration, the **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center** is used to create the user and assign the Intune license.

---

## Accessing Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center

1. Open a web browser.
2. Navigate to the following URL:
   [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com)
3. Log in using an administrator account.

---

## Navigating to Users

1. On the home page, click **Users**.
2. You are redirected to the **All Users** page.
3. This page displays all existing users in the tenant.

---

## Creating a New User

1. Click the **New User (+)** icon.
2. Two options appear.
3. Select **Create new user**.

---

## User Account Details

### Username

* The username is the login name the user will use to sign in.
* In this example, the username is set to **user1**.
* Based on the tenant domain, the login ID becomes:
  [user1@msfsurut.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:user1@msfsurut.onmicrosoft.com)
* The system automatically checks if the username is available.

If a custom domain is configured in Azure Active Directory, it can be selected here.
In this case, only the default domain **msfsurut.onmicrosoft.com** is available.

---

### Name Information

* Enter the display name.
* First name and last name are optional.
* In this example:

  * First name: **Test**
  * Display name: **Test User1**

---

### Password Configuration

* The password can be:

  * Automatically generated, or
  * Manually specified
* At first sign-in, the user must change the password.

In this demonstration:

* A standard password is manually specified.
* Select the option to enter a custom password.
* Enter the password.

---

### Group Membership

* The user can be added to one or more existing groups.
* In this case, no groups exist yet.
* The user is not added to any group.
* Group membership can be assigned later.

---

### Directory Roles

* If administrative permissions are required, the user can be assigned a directory role.
* Examples include Intune Administrator or Global Administrator.
* In this case:

  * The user role remains set to **User**.

---

### Settings

* Set the **Usage Location** for the user.
* In this example, the usage location is set to **India**.
* This setting is required for license assignment.

---

### Optional User Information

You can optionally provide:

* Job title
* Department
* Company name
* Office location

These details are skipped in this demonstration and can be added later.

## Creating the User

1. Click **Create**.
2. A confirmation message appears indicating that the user was successfully created.
3. Refresh the page to update the user list.
4. The newly created user **Test User1** now appears in the list.

## Importance of License Assignment

After creating a user, assigning an Intune license is mandatory.

If a license is not assigned:

* The user will not be able to enroll devices into Intune.
* Device management will not work.

---

## Assigning an Intune License to the User

1. Click on the newly created user (**Test User1**).
2. Under **Manage**, click **Licenses**.
3. Click **Assignments**.

A message appears indicating that no licenses are currently assigned to the user.

---

## Selecting the License

1. In the license section, select **Enterprise Mobility + Security E5**.
2. License options can be enabled or disabled based on organizational requirements.
3. Since this is a trial account, all features are selected.

---

## Saving the License Assignment

1. Click **Save**.
2. A confirmation message appears stating that license assignment succeeded.
3. Close the page.
4. Refresh the screen.

The license **Enterprise Mobility + Security E5** now shows as:

* Assigned
* State: **Active**

---

## Final Result

* The user **Test User1** has been successfully created.
* An Intune license has been assigned.
* The user can now sign in and enroll devices into Microsoft Intune.

---

## Conclusion

This completes the process of creating a user account in Microsoft Intune and assigning an Intune license. With these steps completed, the user is fully ready for device enrollment and endpoint management.
